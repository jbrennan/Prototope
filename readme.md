# Prototope

Prototope is a lightweight, high-performance prototyping framework. Its goals are:
 * enabling rapid iteration
 * high performance execution
 * concepts easily mapped onto production implementation
 
This ([jbrennan repo](https://github.com/jbrennan/Prototope)) is an actively maintained fork of the project, which runs with the latest App Store version of Swift on current versions of iOS / OS X. New features are being added, and pull requests are welcome.

Interfaces to the API are available in Swift. The current implementation runs on iOS and OS X.

Documentation is available [here](http://khan.github.io/Prototope/).

## Including prototope in your existing project

If you plan to include prototope as a submodule from within your project, you'll likely have to do the following from within your project

### getting it
```
    $ git submodule add https://github.com/jbrennan/Prototope
    $ git submodule update --init --recursive
```

the first adds prototope as a git submodule to your project (and clones it outright), but you need the second command in order to pull in prototope's dependencies (namely pop).

### adding it to xcode

This part is somewhat more involved.

1. under *Embedded Libraries*, add Prototope.framework
2. under *Build Settings -> Other Linker Flags*, add `-Objc -lc++`
3. under *Build Settings -> Header Search Paths*, add 
    * `$(SRCROOT)/Prototope/Prototope/`
    * `$(SRCROOT)/Prototope/ThirdParty/` (set it to be recursive)
4. under Build Settings -> Library Search Paths, add `$(SRCROOT)/Prototope/ThirdParty` (set it to be recursive)

### making sure things work

You should be able to test that you've imported everything if you can type `import Prototope` in your ViewController.swift file and if the project *builds*. Xcode may complain that it can't find the bridging header in the gutter, but it's a lie. It can, and if the project builds, you're in good shape.
